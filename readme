This program is an inplementation of an algorithm that, given an certain graph in DOT language, 
returns another DOT graph which contains the strong connected components of the fist graph.

To run it you need to have the graphviz library installed on your computer. Then use a DOT graph
as standard input for the program.

This project idea belongs to Andr√© Guedes (http://www.inf.ufpr.br/andre/). Implementation was made by me and Gustavo Huida.
